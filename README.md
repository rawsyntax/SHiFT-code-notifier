This script is a SHiFT code email notifier for Borderlands 2.

Specifically it reads [twitter](http://twitter.com) and notifies you
when a [SHiFT code](http://support.gearboxsoftware.com/home) is
posted.  This will help you redeem shift codes before they expire.

See the `config.example.yml` for setup information.  The script requires a
twitter account and an email account (smtp).  If you want to receive text message alerts, consider using a [Email SMS gateway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways)
